## Features
- User registration
- User login authentication
- Credential validation
- Menu-driven console interface

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Dictionaries
- Conditional statements
- Functions

## How It Works
1. The user registers by entering a username and password.
2. The credentials are stored in a dictionary.
3. The user can log in using the registered credentials.
4. The system verifies the username and password and displays the result.
